Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players, X and O, to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of being the first to align three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game tracks player moves in real time and displays whose turn it is, offering an interactive and enjoyable experience for players.

One of the key features of this game is the reset button, which allows players to start a new game at any point. When the game is reset, a loading animation is displayed for a brief moment, adding a dynamic touch to the user experience. Additionally, when a player wins, the game triggers a vibrant confetti effect, celebrating the winner’s victory with an eye-catching animation.

The game’s design and functionality make it a great example of using JavaScript for game logic while leveraging CSS for responsive layouts and animations. This project is ideal for demonstrating how basic game development concepts can be implemented in a web environment.
